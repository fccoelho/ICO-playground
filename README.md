# ICO-playground
This repository contains the code for an *toy ICO* developed as part of a [Blockchain programming course](https://github.com/fccoelho/Curso_Blockchain).

- **Update:** With the completion of the 2018 semester, the `FunnyToken` ICO contracts have been 
    [published](https://hackmd.io/s/SJYbFjWaQ) on the Ropsten testnet. You can buy funny tokens by sending money to the TokenSale contract address.  

## Organization of the repository
As this course is offered at least once a year to a different class, the actual implementations of each class will remain on branches named `<year>_project`. The master branch will only contain the basic project structure.

## Getting started instructions
The instruction for setting up your development environment can be found [here](https://github.com/fccoelho/Curso_Blockchain/blob/master/lectures/build-your-own-ICO.md).
